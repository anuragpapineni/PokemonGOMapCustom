# PokemonGo Map

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AHAAAAAAA/PokemonGo-Map.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AHAAAAAAA/PokemonGo-Map) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/AHAAAAAAA/PokemonGo-Map/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/AHAAAAAAA/PokemonGo-Map?branch=master)

Live visualization of all the pokemon (with option to show gyms and pokestops) in your area. This is a proof of concept that we can load all the pokemon visible nearby given a location. Currently runs on a Flask server displaying a Google Maps with markers on it.

Using this software is against the ToS and can get you banned. Use at your own risk.

Building off [Mila432](https://github.com/Mila432/Pokemon_Go_API)'s PokemonGo API, [tejado's additions](https://github.com/tejado/pokemongo-api-demo), [leegao's additions](https://github.com/leegao/pokemongo-api-demo/tree/simulation) and [Flask-GoogleMaps](https://github.com/rochacbruno/Flask-GoogleMaps).
